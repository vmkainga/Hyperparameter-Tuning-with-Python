# Hyperparameter-Tuning-with-Python

Background

Airbnb is an American vacation rental online marketplace company based in San
Francisco, California, United States. Airbnb offers arrangement for lodging, primarily
homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate
listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each
booking.

Problem Statement

As a Data Scientist working for Airbnb, you have been tasked to create a model that
predicts Airbnb rental prices for the city of Amsterdam. Popularity for Airbnbs in
Amsterdam has grown over the past years and you are required to build a solution the
would make optimal predictions.

In this project, you will be required to perform feature engineering on your features and
later hyperparameter tuning techniques to your most accurate model in an effort to
achieve optimal predictions.
